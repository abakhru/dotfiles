SFTP:
----

  Thanks for installing Sublime SFTP! Below are some quick notes to get you
  started with the plugin. Please see http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp for
  the full documentation.
  
  
  There are two major modes of operation:
  1. Mapping a local folder to a remote folder
  2. Working off of a server

  To map a local folder to a remote folder, right-click on it in the side bar
  and select the SFTP/SFTP > Map to Remote... You will enter your connection
  parameters and a new file will be created named sftp-config.json.
  
  Once this file has been saved, all files in that folder and all subfolders
  will have various operations available via the side bar context menu, editor
  context menu and command palette.
  
  
  Working off of a Server
  ----
  
  To work off of a server, use the File menu and select SFTP/FTP > Setup Server...
  You will enter your connection parameters and options then save the file with
  the name you want to give the connection.
  
  Once the server config is saved, you will be automatically connected to the
  server and you can browse and perform actions via the quick panel.
  
  Unfortunely due to limitations of the Sublime Text 2 API, it is not possible
  to present the remote filesystem in the side bar. There are, however, key
  bindings for connecting to servers to help reduce the amount of time remote
  file operations take.
