#############################################################################

[LOCATIONS]
# The test harness uses the following locations to perform a test run.  
# All locations are required (there are no defaults) and should be specified  
# with full path names.
#
# test harness location, e.g. /ath/tle
TLE_Root = /space/src/msg_next/msg/test/athtle
#
# test suite location, e.g. /ath/testsuite
Test_Root = /space/src/msg_next/msg/test/tle
#
# test results location, use ! to overwrite previous run's results, 
# e.g. /home/results! 
Results_Root =/space/src/results!
#
#global parameter file location, e.g. /ath/runinfo
Param_File = /space/src/msg_next/msg/test/athtle/param

[OPTIONS]
# The test harness uses the following options during the course of a test run.
# If any of the options are not included in the workload file, default settings
# are used, as specified below.  
#
#
# Determine the level of detail placed in log files:
Verbose = Yes
# Default value is no, the variable TLE_Verbose is defined with a value
# of 0.  If this is yes, then the variable, TLE_Verbose, is defined
# with a value of 1.  This will also cause the harness to output
# tracing information to the screen.  It will also cause all Test  
# Detailed Log files to be kept even when the run is successful. 
# 
# Amount of time to wait before starting the test run:
Start_Delay =
Use_Local_Parameters = yes
# Default value is 0.
# This could be the absolute time to start the run but must be within the
# next 24 hours. The default unit of measurement is "Minutes".  Other
# possible units of time are "Seconds" and "Hours". When absolute time is used,
# it must be entered as hh:mm [AM or PM]  with hh equaling the 2 digit hour and
# mm equaling the 2 digit minute to start the run. If AM or PM is not used, the
# hours and minutes will be considered to be military time.
#
# Length of time to wait to determine if work execution process has timed out:
 Timeout = 1200
# If the Work execution process times out, the run will be aborted.  The value 
# 0 indicates that no timeout length is requested.  The default unit of time is
# "Minutes". Other possible units of time include "Seconds" and "Hours".  This
# is an optionalentry in the Workload File.  If it is not used, the default
# will be 0 (no timeout for the total run).
#
# Specify the name of the test run:
#Report_Title =Tip SolSparc Messaging Smoke System and Functional tests running Set 3, Schema 2 on JES 4
Report_Title = Testing @ algy.sfbay.sun.com
# Default value is "Untitled Test Run". 
# The report title is used in both the test run's summary log and in the
# test run's summary log.
# 
# Specify the email address of the sender and recipient of the test run results:
#Mail_Results_To = ims_tle_results@sun.com
Mail_Results_To = amit.bakhru@sun.com
Mail_Results_From = svbld@sun.com
# There are no default values for these options, when Mail_Results_To is not specified,
# the report is generated and placed in the Results_Root/RESULTS_HTML directory.  When
# a Mail_Results_To value is specified, and Mail_Results_From is not.  Mail_Results_From
# will be assigned the value of Mail_Results_To.
# Example value: runowner@sun.com
#
# Fully qualified name of the host where web server used for publishing test run 
# results is installed:
ResultStore_Host = algy.sfbay.sun.com
# The default value of this option is taken from the TLEConfig.cnf file.
# Example value: sama.sfbay.sun.com
#
# Specify test run results document root on the web server:
ResultStore_Link =http:/algy.sfbay.sun.com:8080/tle/
# The default value of this option is taken from the TLEConfig.cnf file.
# Example value: http:/sama.sfbay.sun.com:8080/tle/
# 
# Test run results location:
#ResultStore_Path =/h/sama/tle-results/ES6.0/docs/tle/deepak
#ResultStore_Path =/opt/glassfishv3/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot/tle
ResultStore_Path =/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/tle
# The default value of this option is taken from the TLEConfig.cnf file.
# Example value: /h/sama/ath/ES3.0/docs/results/habanero
#
# User name and password used to publish result files to web server: 
ResultStore_User,Passwd =root, iplanet
# The default value of this option is taken from the TLEConfig.cnf file.
# Example value: root, iplanet
# 
# Specify whether a composite style test run report is generated:
Composite_Report = no
# Default value is no.
# This report appends the current run report with previous runs made
# on the same system.  A composite report contains run reports from a 
# collection of systems, such as the collection of systems that are
# used for nightly regression testing.
# 

[SETUP]
# Specify the list of setup modules to execute at the start of the
# test run in the order they should be run.  Currently this type of
# module is provided by a testsuite to install a product.  If no
# SETUP modules are specified, none are run.
# Note: either FLEX or OLD setup modules must be selected (see autoinstall.sh)
# LDAPSSL can be used with either.
#MSGPKGRM
#MSGPKGADD
MSGCONFIGURE
#MMPCONFIGURE
#REMOVEDS7
#DS7_INSTALL
#COMDSCONFIGURE
#REMOVEDS7
#LDAPSSL


[TEST_DIRECTORIES]
# A list of the test directory names (relative to the TEST ROOT) (one per line) 
# that are to have their tests executed this run.  The list may be empty
# if the test run uses keywords to select test cases.
# Note: all test modules should be in some SET (3 currently defined).
# The SETs are designed to be disjoint, and together cover all currently run
# tests EXCEPT the autostress tests which are separate. (Those should be run alone.)
# See autoinstall.sh for details.

[KEYWORDS]
# A list of keywords to use to select test cases for the test run.
# Keywords will only be used by tle if the TEST_DIRECTORIES section is left 
# blank.
# This may be either a simple list of keywords, or a logical expression using
# valid keywords and any of the following operators:
# select only the tests which match both k1 and k2 
#                            keywords'
#     +	 :  'k1 + k2' means 'select all tests for keyword k1 plus all tests for 
#                            keyword k2'
#     -	 :  'k1 - k2' means 'select only the tests for keyword k1 that do not 
#       				     match keyword k2'
#    ( ) :  parentheses may be used to make a complex logical expression,
#                            such as ( k1 - negative ) + k2
# The words 'and', 'plus', and 'minus' may be substituted for the symbols.
# The word 'all' may be used as a keyword, meaning "all tests".
# All keywords and operators must be separated by whitespace.
# The keyword list or expression may be placed on one line, or extend over 
# several lines.
# If a simple list of keywords is used, the operator '+' will be assumed 
# between keywords.
