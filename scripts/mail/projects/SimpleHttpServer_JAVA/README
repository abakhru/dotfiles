#to run the module
java SimpleHttpServer

(this will start the Http server on localhost)

- http://localhost/cpu_usage will give the top output for process_name and cpu_usage.
Note: this will only work for localhost

- SimpleHttpServerTest.jmx is the JMeter Testplan file for performance testing of this application

- functional_test.pl is the normal functional testcases for this application
./functional_test.pl (you might need additional CPAN module to execute this perl script)

- png files are the sample performance runs graphs for 5mins run

- USED json-simple library to convert text (top) output to JSON format.

- cpu_usage context output displays both text output and JSON formatted output.

NOTE: I am not a JAVA expert, so pardon my mistakes but i have tried to do the best in very short amount of time i had.
