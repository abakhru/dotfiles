# This file configures how a certificate is mapped to an LDAP entry.
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
#	certmap=<name>,<name2>
#	<name>.<prop1> =<val1>
#	<name>.<prop2> =<val2>
#
# Notes:
#
# 1.  Mapping can be defined per issuer of a certificate.  If mapping doesn't
#     exists for a particular 'issuerDN' then the server uses the default
#     mapping.
#
# 2.  There must be an entry for <name>=default and issuerDN "default".
#     This mapping is the default mapping.
#
# 3.  '#' can be used to comment out a line.
#
# 4.  DNComps & FilterComps are used to form the base DN and filter resp. for
#     performing an LDAP search while mapping the cert to a user entry.
#
# 5.  DNComps can be one of the following:
#	commented out - take the user's DN from the cert as is
#	empty         - search the entire LDAP tree (DN == suffix)
#	attr names    - a comma separated list of attributes to form DN
#
# 6.  FilterComps can be one of the following:
#	commented out - set the filter to "objectclass=*"
#	empty         - set the filter to "objectclass=*"
#	attr names    - a comma separated list of attributes to form the filter
#
# 7.  CmapLdapAttr -
#       Specifies the name of the LDAP attribute in the diectory containing the
#       subject DN of the certificate. If this attribute is not empty, the baseDN
#       is the convergence configured Base DN (DC root) with a search filter 
#       containing subject DN. If no entries match or if multiple entries match,
#       then the server performs a search with base DN generated from the
#       corresponding DNComps and search filter from corresponding FilterComps.
#
# 8. VerifyCert can be set on or off.
#       on - compare's client's certificate with the certificate found in the LDAP directory
