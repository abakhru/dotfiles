BLD usage

- bld boot
- bld all
- bld printtargets

- type bld()
- type _bld() (the private function)

above mentioned functions defined in /etc/profile.d/sts_buildstatus.sh

- bld test (to run all tests on all the modules, buildbot does this)
- bld rpm

- bld qa_silvertap_test
- bd qa_silvertap_testerrs
(to get all the errors thats happened during previous command)

- bld qa_silvertap_test_basic

- Concepts:
* buildbot url: http://buildbot.silvertailsystems.com:8100
* try jenkins too
* buildbot run on every user specific merge request to master
* jenkins run system-test every nightly, can be on-demand too
* when 'bld test' is ran the second time, it only executes the failed testcase if any, else will exit without doing anything
* bld qa_silvertap_test will build the required/dependent modules, start them and then execute the tests
* system test based on rpm installation is different than STQA and is run as nightly tests
