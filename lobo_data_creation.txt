README.txt
- This documents explains the process of creating required txns log on lobo for STUI testing.

- All lobo logs and reports are @ /sts/eng/qa/ui/ 
(NOTE: /sts needs to be mounted on your vm, usually it always is.)

- Copy an existing shard_0*.log.gz to your local ~/tmp/ dir (for example: from /sts/eng/qa/ui/logs/2014/02-Feb/02/23:00/sb08/)
- gunzip shard_0*.log.gz
- Edit the shard_0*.log according to the data you need
-- For example: say you need an hour data for a user with no user-agent field,
                then you need to delete user-agent field from all the transaction related to the 'user'.
                Deleting the user-agent field from just one or two transaction doesn't work.
- gzip -c shard_0*.log > shard_0*.log.gz

- Goto speedy or any of your vm's /var/opt/silvertail/data/log directory and copy the relevant log file after creating required year/month etc folders.
(NOTE: always use a date/hour/time thats not being used by any of the existing testcase, so as to avoid breaking the exising STUI testcases.)

- touch /var/opt/silvertail/data/tasks/organizer/2014-03-02.23.task
(this will let organizer create reports for the relevant log file we just created).

- Now copy the /var/opt/silvertail/data/logs/2014/02-Feb/02/23:00 to /sts/eng/qa/ui/logs/2014/02-Feb/02/23:00
and /var/opt/silvertail/data/reports/2014/02-Feb/02/23:00 /sts/eng/qa/ui/reports/2014/02-Feb/02/23:00

- AND you have the edited data in lobo.silvertailsystems.com
